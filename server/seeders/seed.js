    about:
      "It is often said that ‘we are what we eat’; we would like to add that ‘we are what we do.’\n\nIrregardless Café & Catering stands as a pioneer in the restaurant business for taking concepts like ‘green’ and ‘sustainable’ long before they became buzz words and putting them into action.\n\nSince 1975, it has been serving local, fresh-from-the-farm, healthy and innovative meals, hosting live jazz and bluegrass nightly and building a strong sense of community.\n\nFounded and operated by Arthur Gordon, owner/chef, the Café opened as the community’s first vegetarian restaurant encouraging its patrons to “eat lower on the food chain”, providing delicious vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free meals. Over the years the menu added fish & seafood, poultry & duck, beef & lamb meals that are accented with lots of local produce. The idea was to feed vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores – to bring the whole community to the table.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Café’s management was dedicated to innovative sustainability initiatives that promote healthy living and giving back to the community. Irregardless Café became the first restaurant in the state of North Carolina to become a completely non-smoking establishment, in 1985. On the roof, ten solar thermal panels heat the Café’s water with renewable energy, and their Well Fed Community Garden ‘welcomes the community into the Garden’ modeling urban agriculture and growing produce for Catering and Café meals.",

    about:
      "Fueled by curiosity and the thrill of the hunt, we seek out makers with a story to tell and inspiration to share. We collect thoughtful, artful, uncommon goods for you and your nest from emerging and independent designers from North Carolina, across the country, and around the world. We carry jewelry, women’s and men's clothing, leather goods, one-of-a-kind clothes for babies and kids, accessories, art, and treasures for you and every room in your home!\n\nABOUT US:\n\nNever one to pass up the opportunity for adventure, in 2002, Jessie Williams packed up her belongings and moved from Chicago to Wilmington, North Carolina. Opening up shop in a tiny 400-square-foot space (let’s be honest, it was a storage closet), Jessie started selling handmade clothing accessories designed by her and her friends. Offering a valuable retail and makers space to other local designers, her business model acted as a launch pad for like-minded, risk-taking, passionate designers, creators, and artists. Now, a handful of years later and with a second retail location opened in the fast-growing Person Street neighborhood near downtown Raleigh, Edge of Urge hosts classes and workshops, trunk shows, special events, and more!\n\nBut it doesn’t end there. In 2019, two new concepts were launched.\n\nEdge of Urge’s men’s offerings were bursting at the seams. We had so many requests for more, more, MORE just for men and even more of that vintage, motorcycle, Americana, utilitarian vibe. So we created a new concept altogether: Unlikely Professionals. Unlikely Professionals is located directly across the street from Edge of Urge Raleigh. Walking through the garage door, you’re greeted with a mix of retail, dive-bar, and workshop rolled into one. Stop in to shop a mix of clothing, shoes, apothecary, self-care, curated vintage, to enjoy the full beer/wine bar—or do it all! While the clothing assortment trends for him, no doubt there is something here for everyone.\n\nJust like Edge of Urge, Unlikely Professionals was built on the mantra of making something from nothing. This space speaks to anyone who believes in their vision to do the damn thing and make themselves proud no matter what the profession. It’s a family vision and execution from Jessie and Derek—even their 2-year-old daughter June painted a wall in the shop. Both Jessie and Derek collectively built businesses from nothing and this space is the culmination of their vision and their own workshops.\n\nWhile Unlikely Professionals was in its early development, Jessie embraced her journey into self-care. Caught up in the hustle of entrepreneurship, Jessie drove herself to exhaustion, isolation, and constant stress. She wanted a change of pace, and to take the time to take care of herself, to build meaningful relationships and introduce new loving rituals into her daily life. In this search for self-love, she discovered she wasn’t the only one craving a transition for the better.\n\nAnd so, she launched Renew, House of Self-Love. Tucked in the heart of downtown Raleigh, this little haven of positivity and light illuminates the street with its neon pink sign, reminding all who pass by “You deserve to be here.” A true gem offering a glimmer of respite, Renew invites visitors to step away from hustle culture for a moment and find that One Perfect Thing to help them—or a loved one—on their own journey to a better self. The curated assemblage of items includes apothecary, books on a multitude of topics relating to wellness and spirituality, food and beverages, incense and candles, and gifts to bring delight into the mundanity of everyday life. We are all so busy that it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself first. Renew aims to help bring you to the top of your daily list.\n\nTogether, these three concepts make up the Edge of Urge family. A little something for everyone, curated with a ravenous joy by the wild at heart for you. We love everything that we do, and we know that you will too.\n\nOUR CUSTOMER:\n\nYou are free. You collect experiences, uncommon objects, stories and friends. Your home is your haven, and you fill it with love and plants and beautiful things that bring you joy. You have at least one recipe that slays at parties, an ever-growing record collection, a long list of books to read, and an even longer list of art openings to attend. You’re curious about where design and pop culture intersect. You are thought of amongst family as the risk-taker, the one who does what she or he wants, and is unaffected by the opinions of others.\n\nYou turn to Edge of Urge, because like us, you appreciate the story and the passion of the independent maker. You value authentic design and the unique expression it allows. You know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that while shopping with us, you’re going to proclaim, “This is EXACTLY what I’ve been looking for!” be it clothing, accessories, gifts your home or treasures to share with your friends.\n\nAnd even though we already know you, we can’t wait to finally meet you.\n\nxoxoxox\n\nEOU",

    about:
      "Burnie Batchelor Studio and Shutterbugs Boutique are one of Raleigh’s oldest family businesses. We trace our beginnings to 1951 when Burnie Batchelor founded his portrait photography studio. We are located on Oberlin Road at the edge of Raleigh’s first shopping center, Cameron Village. Like Raleigh, Burnie Batchelor Studio has grown and expanded. As a third generation family business, we know that our success depends on excellence, uniqueness and an uncompromising commitment to client satisfaction.\n\nThe Photography Studio is owned by Burnie’s daughter Joy, a Certified Master Photographer and Craftsman. Joy has won numerous state and national honors for her images of families, children, and business executives. Joy is actively engaged in Professional Associations at both the State and National levels.\n\nJoy and her daughter Christen started Shutterbugs Boutique in 2004. Originally, the primary objective was to offer upscale, clothing for portraits, weddings, christenings and other special family events. By listening to client’s requests, Shutterbugs has become “the place” to find unique children’s clothing for special occasions in Raleigh and the surrounding areas. Shutterbugs offers manufacturers like Feltman Brothers, Auraluz, Anavini, Bella Bliss, Bailey Boys and close to 100 more that you will  not find anywhere else in the Raleigh area.  As demand has grown, Shutterbugs has added hard to find, adorable (non department store) clothing for virtually every occasion. Today, Shutterbugs is the place Mothers and Grandmothers go for heirloom clothing, christening gowns, tops, leggings, short sets, socks, shoes and hair bows.  Shutterbugs has unique baby accessories and baby gifts for little ones. Despite ongoing requests for more ages, we cap our offerings at age newborn to 12 for girls and Newborn to 6 for boys.  \n\nShopping at Shutterbugs is truly a fun, unique experience. We are inspired by our clients, their families, their style and their stories. We want them to experience our offering of the best products the market has to offer. Our  team of experts are here to offer their assistance and support for your every request. Every item in our boutique has been hand -picked by our mother and daughter founders. We are honored to serve as a resource to moms, dads, grandparents, families and friends in helping you select the most cherished gifts for the little ones in your lives. We strive to build a unique relationship with each of our clients in hopes of serving you for years to come. \n\nThank you so much for visiting,\n\n Joy Batchelor King and Christen Batchelor Whitehead  \n\n ",

      "\nOur downtown Raleigh workshop is at the heart of everything we do.\nIt's our design center and where we do most of our production. It's where we have team lunches, spontaneous ping pong matches, and late-night collabs. It's where we plug into the hometown community that will always be the center of who we are.\n\nWe hunt down materials that make our mouths water.\nYou know when you're really hungry and you smell some insanely good food and have trouble thinking about anything else? We look for fabrics that give us that feeling. Materials that radiate character and texture and have the capacity to tell stories - to wear in ways that hint at the life lived inside them.\n\n\n\nFit is part of our craft.\nHandcrafting allows us to do things that make our clothes fit you better. Our shirts and jackets are tailored, but give you room to move with a pleat in the back (they have to pass our ping pong test). We shape and sew pockets in a way that makes your arse look good.\n\nWe fieldtest.\nAs a couple, we've always had a thing for clandestine shenanigans, why-not-give-it-a-try adventures (on our first date, we scaled a bell tower). We believe the things we wear ought to encourage the things we want to do, whatever they may be. So, we design and we build and we test. When we're finished with our part, our clothes are ready for just about anything. The next chapter is all yours.",

    about:
      "We named our store Ealdwine as an homage to Alden. Ealdwine (pronounced Ald-wine) is an Old English name that means “Old Friend”, from which the name Alden is derived. Our mission is to serve as Raleigh’s finest men’s shop and develop lasting friendships in the community like our name implies.\n\nIn addition to Alden, we are proud to offer a well curated assortment of some of the finest brands in the menswear industry such as – Coppley, Frank Clegg Leatherworks, William Henry Jewelry, Ashland Leather, Randolph Engineering, Mizzen + Main, Naked & Famous Denim and much more. Our apparel assortment will include both ready-to-wear and made-to-measure options.\n\nOUR STORY\nEaldwine is the passion project of two friends, Matt Gray and Jim Pietryka, over our affinity for Alden Shoes. We met in the Summer of 2017 via Styleforum, an online menswear forum where we are both active participants on the Alden thread. Upon discovering that we both lived in the same town, we joked about opening a men’s wear shop in Raleigh because Alden Shoes are in such short supply in North Carolina. There was no go-to destination in Raleigh for fine menswear in a city that has quickly become a vibrant hub for business and entertainment.\n\nFlash forward to the Spring of 2018, Matt was contacted by Adam Knott from Alden of Carmel, an Alden retailer since 1994. Adam noted Matt’s passion for Alden through the photographs he posted of his extensive shoe collection on Instagram. Matt’s passion, coupled with the absence of menswear options in and around Raleigh, led to Adam asking Matt if he would consider opening his own shop. Their ensuing conversation was the genesis of Ealdwine.\n\nWe sincerely thank you for taking the time to learn more about us. We are excited and humbled to be a part of the Raleigh community. We look forward to meeting you soon.",

Watch this video for a little pep in your step.⠀\n\nAfter leaving my corporate career as a Vice President of Communications and Change Management for an Investment Bank, I decided to transfer my skills over to help win people over to the idea of using their purchasing power for good.\nWhat started in October 2015 as a uniform delivery truck turned do-good fashion truck, has turned into something much greater.\n \nWe currently partner with 50+ brands that work all over the world, providing dignified jobs and fair wages to inspiring artisans and makers in vulnerable communities.\n \nAfter launching our brick & mortar store in Downtown Raleigh in November 2016, we quickly realized that while customers were excited to intercede in the life of a woman in the developing world though their purchases, they were also in desperate need of someone to encourage their worth as well.\nIt’s our hope that you find that here.",

    about:
      " Benchmark Autoworks opened as an ultra-convenience auto  service facility in September 2012 in downtown Raleigh. We have strived to provide top-end auto  repair for every customer from the start. We have grown through that time and offer 5-star services and have been  blessed with many great reviews from happy customers.  We  serve customers from the local area, with some customers from as far as 4  hours North of us. On top of that, we  have had a number of traveling customers in need who have searched us out  because of our high ratings.\n\n\n\nMore about us:\n\nWe originally opened in downtown Raleigh within a few  blocks of all the high-rise office buildings loaded with the daytime  workforce, comprised of City, County, and State Government, High Tech, Banking  and Finance, Architecture firms, Utility providers, Judicial system, and  Lawyers. Our customers drop their cars  off for service with almost the same ease as they do for their daily parking;  sometimes we are more convenient than their local parking. We also offer pre-arranged shuttle to and  from work. Most customers leave their  car with us in the morning, to be repaired by end of their workday. Sometimes repairs can take more than a day,  but we have relationships with multiple vendors so that we can usually get  parts within an hour; two hours if they have to come from a regional  warehouse. Our customer lounge is  almost always empty, because we are so convenient to their work places. This has worked very well for us.\n\nOur services range from the day-in, day-out services for Brakes,  Oil change, Suspension such as Wheel Bearings, Shocks and Struts, Control Arms,  also CEL diagnosis, Exhaust, Cooling system, and Air Conditioning; which are  common services from most shops; to more unique services for Timing Belts,  Head Gaskets, Engine rebuild, Engine replacement, Transmission repair, almost  everything except body shop. So, when  you look for someone to provide your car with maintenance or repair services,  do you want someone who only knows how to do the easy stuff, or do you want  someone who really understands how your car works?\n\nOur focus is to provide quality repairs at reasonable  prices. We have invested in top-end  diagnostic equipment and tools to do the job right. We have 6 lifts, Snap-On Verus diagnostic system, Autel  diagnostic computer, Pico scope, CarDaq-M programmer, plus a significant  collection of other diagnostic tools to help get the diagnosis right the first  time. However there is no substitute  for experience and talent, and we have technicians with double-digit  experience in fixing cars and trucks, plus we have also hired trained  technician graduates from NASCAR Technical Institute and Wake Tech Community  College. We are not exclusive to those  schools, but they have active training programs serving students who are local  to Raleigh after graduation. ",

      "In our 24+ years in business we have seen time and again talented students that give up on learning because they think they do not have the talent to play their instrument. In truth it’s not the student that’s the issue, it’s their instrument. Would you continue to play a sport or work at any activity if you have inadequate equipment or borrowed equipment that does not work properly or fit your needs? Of course not. When learning to play music you need the correct instrument that fits your body and your musical needs. Instruments must be the right size, properly tune up and stay in tune and have the correct set up for proper playing functions. The good news is that to get a quality instrument you do not need to spend a lot of money.",
